<h1>AI for Skin Disease Detection</h1>

A multi-class skin disease classifier using CNN, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV1 on the DermNet dataset.

---

## Project Overview

This project applies deep learning to dermatology by classifying 23 types of common skin diseases using image data. It compares performance across a custom CNN, MobileNetV1, and DenseNet121 using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## Current Features

- Data preprocessing from the DermNet dataset  
- Custom CNN model implemented from scratch  
- Transfer learning with MobileNetV1  
- Transfer learning with DenseNet121  
- Training, validation, and testing splits  
- Accuracy & loss visualization using Seaborn  
- Confusion matrix evaluation using Scikit-plot

## üîß Models Implemented

| Model         | Pretrained | Params Frozen | Notes                         |
|---------------|------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| CNN (custom)  | ‚ùå          | N/A            | Built from scratch            |
| MobileNetV1   | ‚úÖ          | Most layers    | Lightweight and fast          |
| DenseNet121   | ‚úÖ          | Most layers    | Deep model with strong reuse  |

---

## Evaluation

Each model is trained for 5 epochs and evaluated on a validation split. Confusion matrices and accuracy/loss plots are generated.

---

## Requirements

```
use conda to install the environment_full.yml
```
